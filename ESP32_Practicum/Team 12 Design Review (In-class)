Team 12 Design Review (Inclass)
Version and date are good ✔️
Use 5V symbol for vcc (instead of lines) ✔️
Add connector symbol to 12V input ✔️
Side note, add the the schematic first then to the PCB ✔️
Label connections instead of lines “UR OUT” “UR TX” ✔️
Power to esp ->critical to function-> add capacitors to ground ✔️
Add bypass capacitors to multiple locations as needed ✔️
I^2C missing 4.7k Ohm resistors-> add in physical pull up resistors, don't use software
3.3V add symbol and label for where power comes from, don’t use lines ✔️
SDA TO SDK add test points ✔️
Add test points as needed ✔️
Relay-> will relay click at 3.3V? (GPIO 32), if not use smaller relay that will click sooner or use the 5 volt rail and try click it ->critical issue-> add snubber diode-> reverse bias parallel with the coil ✔️
Use ground symbol instead of wires ✔️
Add led’s for heartbeat monitoring and for testing
Add test points to schematic ✔️ and pcb
Use test point diameter .1” or 1mm holes 
C1 & C2 check floating pins, no pins should be floating-> if floating make it go to a test point-> ✔️
Add stitching-> ground to vias ✔️
Use thick wires 10, 20, 30 mm ✔️
