## Team 8 (Eric Sanman and Chuong Vo) Design Review of Team 12   

# Schematic
- Pull-up resistors for I2C connections
- Move power input to left side of schematic
- Add 0.1uF from 12v input to gnd
- Add box around regulator and other circuit areas for explanation
- Add resistors to high current pin connections


# PCB
- Keep traces away from edges of board, DRC compliant
- Use ground planes better
- 2.54mm between pins 
- Use 0805 size resistors,  label them on pcb
- Make pcb larger
- Make power traces larger

# Overall
- Add broken component warning
